<center><li><i>1. Think About the Reasons You’re in School: You enrolled in online courses for good reasons: perhaps you want a better job, are preparing for a new career field or want to earn a credential, such as a degree or certificate.</i></center>
<center><li><i>2. Create Realistic Goals: Setting goals is an important part of being a student. Big, audacious goals are great, but it’s also wise to keep your goals realistic, or you risk disappointment. Set smaller, achievable goals at first, such as completing a chapter of required reading or writing an outline for an assignment.</i></center>
<center><li><i>3. Visualize the Outcome: Classwork, studying and writing papers can keep you so focused that it’s easy to lose sight of the outcomes of all your hard work. Take time to zoom out and look at the big picture.</i></center>
<center><li><i>4. Create a Sensible Schedule: Keeping your goals realistic and attainable requires a sensible schedule. It might help to make a list of everything you have going on, from online courses and work to family obligations and social time.</i></center>
<center><li><i>5. Reward Yourself
Accomplishing a goal or completing a project feels great! That alone is rewarding, but doing something nice for yourself can create even more internal motivation.</i></center>
